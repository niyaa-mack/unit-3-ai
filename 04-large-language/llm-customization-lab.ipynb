    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** LLM is the process of generating, understanding the data that is given to you. It is different from traditional software because if you are not specific of what you want from the LLM then it wont give you what you expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** To \"prompt\" in LLM it means to give the LLM directions to give you the best response. Prompting is important due to the fact that if you are recieving a response from the LLM then you would need prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some techniques are few-shot prompting and practicing prompting to use for the AI models. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some concerns are that using AI can be unaccurate, not trained properly, and giving out false information. "
